	<h3>Similar Site</h3>
	<p><a href="http://www.onthesnow.ca/canada/ski-resorts.html">"On the Snow"</a> is a ski report and resort review site that is very popular. It adds important functionality like sorting by region. One added functionality would be the ability to sort by resort type. This could be something added to differentiate this site. Further the complete table that makes it easy to compare all hills is a feature that allows for easy comparision. </p>
