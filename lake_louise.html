<h2>Lake Louise Ski Resort</h2>
<p>Lake Louise is located 1 hr 45 minutes away from Calgary, Alberta putting it just in reach of day trippers from Calgary. This resort offers more challenging terrain than the average hill. From the view of the hill you can see the iconic Chateau Lake Louise. Choose to either focus on skiing or coughing up dollars to stay in this iconic hotel. If you choose the later plan to take time off skiing to stake on the lake and drink hot chocolate in the ice palace.</p>
