	<p>Revelstoke ski resort is a difficult and hardcore resort located deep in the BC rockies. The town is far and isolated from all major cities making this a destination resort. This resort is not family focused. There are few activities outside of the resort. Revelstoke townsite is not well developed. This makes this a purly skiing destination.</p>
